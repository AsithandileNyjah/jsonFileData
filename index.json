I am currently studying fullstack development at Life Choices Academy. I fell in love with coding in my role at Fundza, as I had to liaise with ICT service providers to ensure that the site was working well and offering the audience the best user experience. I then left the organisation to pursue software development studies to achieve my goal of being a software developer. In my spare time I like to reading, my favourite book is The Rapture of Canaan by Sheri Reynolds an hounarable mention would be, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. I also love listen to music, Guillotine by Jon Bellion is my favourite song of all time. And last but not least, I love learning more about coding - I take it one language at a time.",
