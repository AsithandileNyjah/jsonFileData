            "paragraph": "I am an aspiring fullstack developer, a dynamic and passionate writer and former Community Coordinator & Tech Support at Fundza Literacy Trust, a South African non-profit organization that promotes literacy and a love of reading among young people. I am a recent graduate of the fullstack development course offered at Life Choices Academy. I fell in love with coding in my role at Fundza, as I had to liaise with ICT service providers to ensure that the site was working well and offering the audience the best user experience. I then left the organisation to pursue software development studies to achieve my goal of being a software developer. In my spare time I like reading, my favourite book is The Rapture of Canaan by Sheri Reynolds an hounarable mention would be, The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. I also enjoy listening to music while learning more about coding - I take it one language at a time. I also enjoy anime and basketball.",
